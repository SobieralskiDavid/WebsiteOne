            <i>Adam Curtis</i>, as seen is this picture, looks rather mild, he has that kind of middle England jovial quality, that sort of Pimms and Pimlico air, that genteel spirit that comes with the contented life, but not all things are what they seem.
            </p>
            <p>   
            At the very heart of his documentary work is a kind of sprawling surveyance, capturing every nuance of the enfeebled mind and traceing it back to some dark, deliberate plan.The themes of power and people's struggle against it become very real and at times disconcerting, like struglling up a hill to only find a mountain or falling down a well to only discover an abyss.
            </p>
            <p>
            There is a strange  comfort in watching his work, the mad dogs of the mind where not so mad after all, and the pervading injustices that seem now as though a scene on a reel,  become likening connections between far off humans.Each chattering, mad, poor soul's poured like  endless drips into a sea of struggle, somehow survive the serpentine scythe. </p>
            <p>
            And Adam, well he goes on, bludgeoning the mind with that sharp edged realism that only comes of something you know to be true, for in every meek and soft mannered heart there is a craven beast that knows its own distortions well, and only lays hidden by the soporific inclinations of comfort.
            </p>
            <p>
            Picking at the seams, each torn scene delivers a new reminder and in it an exclamation that we as people are merely flank and flannel, draped over a conspiring sense of society like a gauze fused to the skin, hiding all the dark blemishes of our mangled mortal throne.
            </p>
            It is this sense of derailment, conjured up in the watcher that allows for a brief sense of reflection, like a victim transformed into a witness, all the bare bones of our inducement are splaid across the screen in an unending riot of malfeasance.
